# Deep Learning Study Repository ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my deep learning study repository! This repo serves as a collection of practice notebooks, experiments, and projects as I learn various deep learning concepts. 

## ðŸ“š **Contents**
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter/Colab notebooks covering topics like neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and more.
- **Data**: All datasets used in the notebooks are stored in the [`Data`](./Data) folder.
- **Projects**: Small-scale implementations of models (e.g., image classification, NLP tasks).

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamadkhan345/dl-study-repo.git
